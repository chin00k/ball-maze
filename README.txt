To start the game:

-run manager.py and it will start a GUI manager window
-For a first run, just click start and a game window will open

How to play:

The goal is to get to the green portal. You (the ball) can only move up/down or side to side.
You bounce of the blocks, but you can interact with them too. Every time you hit a block, you
are "in control" of that block. You will see a blue chevron on the block that is pointing in
some direction. This direction is the direction that the block will send you the next time it
is hit, but it will not do anything yet. Use the left key (<-) to rotate the chevron. Note that
the block that you are in control of changes if you hit another one. When the chevron points
where you want to go, press the down key to become committed. The chevron will change to green
and the direction will be locked in. The block in control will also no longer change. When you
hit the block that is committed, it will send you in the direction that the chevron is pointing.
You will also now be able to control other blocks. Make your way around the map until you hit
the portal and win. Your score is how many times you committed a block.

Gameplay notes:

-Don't hit the spikes, they kill you.
-If you are in a bad spot, or if the portal didn't generate in a good spot (or if it didn't generate at all)
 press the r key (r) to reset the portal and the player ball.

Advanced gameplay:

-This game has a seed generation system like Minecraft.
-To use it, close any game windows that are open and enter literally anything in the seed field. An empty  string works too. Then, press start to start with the new seed.
-It uses sha256, so there are almost infinite combinations.
-Each seed also generates a unique map and only that unique map.
-The seed controls the placement of blocks and spikes.

-The portal is randomly generated, but it can be manually set for a 100% predicatable gameplay experience.
-To use the feature, close any open game windows, check the portal coordinates checkbox, and enter an x an y
 coordinate in the correct box. A valid coordinate is an integer from 0 to 15 inclusive.

-To clear all entry fields in the manager, press clear all.

Known Issues:

-All these have been encountered in testing but are very rare.

-The portal may not generate. Just press r to reset.
-The game window might reopen after being closed. This requires the manager itself to be opened and closed.
-The chevron may not appear after hitting a block. Close the window and start again. If the issue persists,   try a new seed.

This game was built on windows 10, so things such as the GUI and the 1 required font may behave differently on other systems. The font is included with the game but who knows. 
There are no parts that explicitly require windows functionality. I did some testing on Linux and it was fine, except the GUI was ugly.

Requirements:

-Built-in modules: hashlib, random, os, math

-Non built-in modules: numpy, tkinter, pygame
